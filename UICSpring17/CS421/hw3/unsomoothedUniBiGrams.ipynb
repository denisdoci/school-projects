Maravich amazed his family and friends with his basketball abilities from an early age. He enjoyed a close but demanding father–son relationship that motivated him toward achievement and fame in the sport. Maravichs father, Petar \"Press\" Maravich, the son of Serbian immigrants[5][6][7][8][9] and a former professional player-turned-coach, showed him the fundamentals starting when he was seven years old. Obsessively, Maravich spent hours practicing ball control tricks, passes, head fakes, and long-range shots.')\n",

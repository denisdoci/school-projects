Problem 4.3:

Obviously, I couldn’t get this to work for my problem.
That being said I found some online statistics for a similar problem
so I would like to use that for analysis to answer this question.
They used two wikipedia articles one for the big bang and the other
for Brittany Spears. When they received the probabilities they sorted 
all the words by the largest probability. One thing that was obvious was that
the most common words were in fact words that were articles and pronouns. 
I.E. the, they, he, her, a, an. This is not really unexpected as these words
are necessary to compose a sentence on the whole. But with the least common words,
you had a much more descriptive view of what the actual articles were about. 

Example 
Big bang: universe, proton, dark, matter
Brittany Spears: Kentwood, Louisiana, glory, vegas

You get a much more specific description of each article. Although those words 
as a whole don’t give you a full description you do get a more rounded view of
what these articles actually mean.

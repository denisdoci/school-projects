//-------------- README project5 ---------------//

//----------     CS 211 ----------------------//


This project was done in an Eclipse IDE
The project5 package was made automatically
by the IDE. I'm not sure if thats going to affect
the grading itself, but I thought I'd leave this
hear as a warning. Also if there is underflow in the 
stack, the program will print out an error message
and subsequently terminate.
